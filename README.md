# How to Use

##### 1. Via Anaconda and pip (recommended):
    conda create -n PLAN python==3.11.0
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    conda activate PLAN
    
##### PS1: If there are some problem, you can use pip tsinghua channels. 
    
##### PS2: If there some problem about net, you can also install lib one by one by pip. Some lib is needed (Torch,PyG,Numpy,Pandas,Geopy,tqdm,tensorboard.)

##### 2. Download Weights ([Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OX1IE6Oh5AsOSXjdlAShVzWK0u3bGV9G/view)) file and put it 'model' dir.
##### 3. Download sac file and put it 'data/1h_data/' dir. You can download it through [STP](https://scedc.caltech.edu/data/waveform.html) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_VmMz0gapc6oEYOIKoBZJWg0ulMgR-2a/view).
##### 4. Open Tutorial_PLAN.ipynb in Notebook dir.
